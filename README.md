# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository!

Hello world, my name is Ariel Sharon and I'm a student at SBCC studying as a Computer Science Major. I like to write code in all languages, and can write code in Java, C, and Python, and will be taking a C++ course in Fall 2017. Just trying to get some out-of-school programming exposure and hopefully experience. I'm really looking forward to seeing what GitHub has to offer!
